# CullingDemo
Same as the QuaternionDemo, but faces that shouldn't be visible are not drawn

- Controls: D-pad for rotation, A/B to bring up debug
- Rotate a cube around the X and Y axes, but with quaternions
- I made this to find out if the Arduboy could even handle this kind of thing
- Surprisingly, the debug messages cause much more slowdown than the 3D
